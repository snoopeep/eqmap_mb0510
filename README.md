<br><br>
#### 0510 Updates
- Including the map of facilities<br>
- The map layer we want to enable interaction with is 'trc18-spop-2step'
Question: How do we incorporate 'Hover to show popup for information' at the last section of the page.<br>
#### Some possible solution:<br>
1. Enable map interaction only on the entry of the last chapter.<br>
2. Or we simply link to a separate map for the interactive part.
