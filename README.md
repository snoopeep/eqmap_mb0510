Including the map of facilities<br>
Question: How do we incorporate 'Hover to show popup for information' at the last section of the page.<br>
Some possible solution:<br>
1. Enable map interaction only on the entry of the last chapter.<br>
2. Or we simply link to a separate map for the interactive part.
